        <p class="subheading" style="margin-top: 3px;" id="pageTitle">Admix's complete website</p>

        <p class="pageText">
            When I started at Admix, one of my early jobs was to re-write the old website. It led to a deep research phase of the company's audience and challenges and was a great intro to the brand.</p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Two years later, the company changed its goals with the website and I got to revisit the project with a new team and a new goal to reach. Read all about it below this lovely little screenshot.</p>

        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/HomePageSub.png" />
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="pageSubTitle">The project</h3>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">The goal:</red> Work with the entire web redesign team to educate users on Admix's core features and benefits while working towards a premium brand voice. At the same time, manage and direct the creative team on asset creation.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Stakeholders:</red> Product Lead, Lead Designer, CEO
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">My role:</red> Lead Writer, Creative Team Lead
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Challenges:</red> Admix's core product is new, so all users coming to the site need to be educated as efficiently as possible. The bigger challenge? 75% of website visitors will be developers and the rest will be advertisers. They have vastly different needs so each page needs to be constructed based on the audience.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Timeline:</red> Two months for the full website redesign.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Needless to say, it was a chellenge!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/Benefits.png" />
        </div>


        <h3 class="pageSubTitle">The process</h3>

        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Research:</red> When the project started, my focus for week one was getting the creative team briefed in and happy with what they were doing while the website itself was built. When they were doing their thing, I got to do mine.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            I was lucky on this redesign because a) I'd already done a lot of audience research the first time I wrote the website, and b) I had historic usage data from the old website on how the site was being used. I knew, for example, that the below tool added by the sales team after my first go at the site was LOVED by developers. Using Hotjar heatmaps and Hubspot tracking, I realised that there were some major improvements to be done though.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Here's the old version. Note that I've made it black and white to give a sense of sadness, because this thing is a mess.
        </p>

        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/OldTool.png" />
        </div>

        <p class="pageText">
            Four pages in a landing page form? An out-of-place link to speak to a team member? A disclaimer message referring to a button that isn't even there on page one? Not ideal.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Here's what I did with it instead.
        </p>

        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/Tool2.png" />
        </div>

        <p class="pageText">
            Much better! Just two pages to reduce users losing interest, no confusing links or text, and it doesn't start with a prompt to pop in an email which immediately turned away a lot of users.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            This version did come after a few iterations. There was one with three pages, one with more text, one with just one page &mdash; all were shown to groups of developers on the old site and the best usability came out on top.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Speaking of the old site, I actually used it as a testing ground for various bits of copy for this one. The headline all the way at the top of this page? I arrived on that after a while of A/B testing using a Wordpress plugin before the new site even had a final design. That sped things up immensely.
        </p>



        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Collaboration:</red> Of course I was doing none of this in isolation.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            There was an incredible sales team who knew everything there was to know about what developers and advertisers would want on their pages, there were designers who were as keen to A/B test layouts as I was to test copy, and there were the engineers piecing it all together.
        </p>


        <p class="pageText">
            <red style="color: #E00000;">Result:</red> As a whole team, we were one week behind schedule for the initial release. Not bad with a timeline like that, and we saw an immediate boost in conversion.
        </p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Not bad at all.
        </p>
