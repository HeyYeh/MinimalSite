        <p class="subheading" style="margin-top: 3px;" id="pageTitle">The Inventory Discovery Tool</p>

        <p class="pageText">
            Alright, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room:</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">
            What the hell is an inventory discovery tool?</p>

        <p class="pageText">
            As background, Admix is a company that allows developers to place ads inside their game worlds. Think of billboards in a city, except in virtual gaming environments.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">
            The Inventory Discovery Tool is a web-hosted piece of software that acts as a directory of every game using the Admix plugin along with key demographic and user data. It allows advertisers to choose the perfect campaign for their brand, letting them choose specific locations, age groups, and more for some targeted advertising action.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">
            It's a very cool tool, and I was lucky enough to get to handle the UX writing of it. Take a look at the two select bits below:</p>
        
        <h3 class="pageSubTitle">Main search</h3>
        
        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/Menu.png" />
        </div>
        
        <p class="pageText">A lot of this is fairly obvious and the first draft was what we ended up going with. 'Search game name', for example, unsurprisingly had zero issues in testing, and neither did "Category", "Country", or "Rating".</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">There are two bits that are worth mentioning though:</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">Firstly, 'DAILY AVAILS'. This went through a couple of versions early on, the first one being 'DAILY POTENTIAL PLACEMENTS', and the second being 'AD SPACES PER DAY'. Both just way too long and ineffective.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">I was pulling away from using the word 'avails' even though it meant the same thing as 'daily potential placements' because I was worried that &mdash; even though it is advertiser jargon and this is a platform for advertisers &mdash; that there would be a portion of users completely in the dark about what it meant.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">Long story short, testing proved that pretty much all users had no issue with it. Writing for simplicity sometimes means using jargon, and that was a good lesson to learn.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">The other point to mention is that 'Add to collection' also went through some iterations. At first we were going with a 'favourites' list, then a 'campaign shortlist' thing for a bit. Ultimately, 'collection' just resonated better with the audience in terms of their expected functionality from the feature.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">That wasn't an exciting story. Sorry about that.</p>
        
        <h3 class="pageSubTitle">Add to/create collection pop-ups</h3>
        
        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/Collection1.png" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="pageImage">
            <img class="image" src="../../Assets/DigitalPages/Collection2.png" />
        </div>
        
        <p class="pageText">I won't bore you by breaking down every little thing that went into these pop-ups, I'm just proud of their elegant simplicity and love the design that the team created.</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">Shout out to teamwork!</p>
        
        <p class="pageText">That's right, this portfolio is now a Saturday morning cartoon.</p>
